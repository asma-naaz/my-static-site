# My Static Website with GitHub Pages

* This is a simple static website deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
* In this project, I created a basic HTML page and customized it with CSS.
* The website is hosted for free on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible via a live URL.

## Steps to Host the Website on GitHub Pages

# 1. Create the `index.html` File
The first step was to create the `index.html` file. Here’s the basic HTML structure:

# Create a New GitHub Repository
* I created a new GitHub repository for the project with a name like my-static-website.
* The repository is public so that anyone can view the project and the live website.

#  Push Files to the GitHub Repository
* After setting up the repository, I pushed my local files to GitHub using Git. Here's how the files were added:

# Initialized the git repository using git init.

* Added the index.html and style.css files to the repository using git add ..
* Committed the changes with a message using git commit -m "second commit".
* Pushed the changes to GitHub using git push -u origin main.

# Enable GitHub Pages

* To host the static website, I enabled GitHub Pages for the repository:
* In the Settings section of the repository, I navigated to the Pages section.
* I selected the main branch as the source and chose the root folder for the website files.

After saving, GitHub Pages provided me with a live link to access the website.

#  Access the Live Website
After enabling GitHub Pages, I was able to access my live website through the following URL:

https://asma-naaz.github.io/my-static-site/

This link will display the static website that I deployed.

Customize with CSS
* I added a style.css file to customize the look and feel of the website. The file includes simple styling rules, such as background color, text alignment, and font styles:

The style.css file was linked in the index.html file, and the changes were pushed to the GitHub repository.

# What is GitHub Pages?
* GitHub Pages is a service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. You can publish HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and have them served to the public for free. It’s a simple and effective way to share projects, portfolios, blogs, or documentation.

# Why Did I Use GitHub Pages?

I chose GitHub Pages because it’s:

* Free: GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites without any costs.
* Easy to Set Up: With just a few steps, I was able to deploy my website directly from my GitHub repository.
* Reliable: GitHub provides a stable platform with good uptime for hosting personal or project websites.
* Integrated with GitHub: Since my code is already on GitHub, GitHub Pages makes it seamless to host and update my website without needing a separate hosting service.

# Conclusion

* By following the steps mentioned above, I successfully hosted a static website using GitHub Pages. It’s a great way to showcase your work or host small personal projects without spending any money.
